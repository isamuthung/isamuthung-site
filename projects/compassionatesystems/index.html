        <p class="opening-paragraph">My first introduction to the Compassionate Systems Framework was in May of 2022 right as my freshman year of high school was coming to an end. By that point I had regained my interest in school and crafted a narrative that I was an educational changemaker, but I still felt lost because while I'd gathered observations about the system from a student's perspective, I had no way of making sense of it all in a way that yielded clear answers. Despite this, after hearing about a workshop that was in some way related to education, I demonstrated interest in it, and through a series of fortunate connections, I managed to get my foot in the door being the lone high schooler at an Introductory Workshop in Ventura, California. This wasn't just a thought experiment anymore. This was the real-deal. I was finally going to meet people who could reshape the system I was living in.</p>

        <p>The workshop was co-facilitated by Mette Boll and Peter Senge, both co-founders for the Center for Systems Awareness focused on reimagine education through a compassionate lens. Part of their thesis is that education is a leverage point for lasting change because to change society at large, it must begin with changing the systems that nurture the people who live in it. Most of the attendees were educational administrators—people well into their forties and fifties working in school policy, county offices, or statewide programs. Despite the decades in age difference, I felt right at home. By that time I had developed my own thoughts about changing education yet there weren't many people that shared my passion in my own circle. Suddenly though, I was in a room full of people whose full-time job was to think about impactful change efforts and with every free moment I dove into discussions about the shortcomings that needed addressing or weighing the effects of one solution over another.</p>

        <p>I still remember that workshop vividly—the journal we were given, the meditative practices, the sense that we were united in a common pursuit to reimagine what education could be. We explored the Compassionate Systems tools and practices like the Mandala for Systems Change or the Iceberg Model. We were guided through visioning exercises and examined systems dynamics, distinguishing between symptomatic and fundamental solutions and considering how they could be applied in our local contexts. That's where I met Rask, a member of the Youth Leadership Team, who told me about their recently formed Youth Council—an online cohort of young people eager to carry this work forward. I learned that this workshop wasn't a one-off, but rather part of a growing community adopting Compassionate Systems to make changes within education. Little did I know I stumbled across an organization making big and bold ripples across the global movement to transform education.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <p>I applied to the Youth Council, got in, and soon found myself connecting with peers from countries I couldn't even point to on a map at that time. I had mixed feelings of being out of my depth yet excitement for participating in something bigger than me. Despite being separated by oceans, the council members and I shared the same sense of curiosity, compassion, and a recognition that school wasn't equipping us with the skills and experiences we'd need for life. Above all, what inspired me most was that they felt driven enough to take matters into their own hands and do the work that would lead to change in their community. After about a year on the council, I was invited to join the Youth Leadership Team who were the ones who designed and hosted the council along with other projects. This meant moving from participant to co-creator to facilitate the council alongside other youth. This was the first step towards creating a council for youth, by youth and I'm proud to have been a part of that legacy.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, I joined Cohort 5 of the Master Practitioner program, the Center's year-long certification for educators of all kinds. Once again, I found myself among the youngest participants—just me and another high schooler from Thailand—but I welcomed the challenge. I knew the program would push me in ways I hadn't yet experienced, and I valued the wisdom of older peers as much as they valued my perspective. One of the highlights of the program was a week-long in-person retreat in Garrison, New York. Our cohort, about 40 people from dozens of nationalities, had spent most of the year connecting virtually so meeting in person felt like a profound miracle. We shared stories, deepened our practice, and created opportunities to collaborate in our work. It's not easy being often the only young person in the room who cares about transforming education. Most students tolerate school as it is, believing they can't change it. But being surrounded by educators who are doing the good work I felt a renewed hope that one day we'll see the light at the end of the tunnel, and our efforts will have been worth it.</p>

        <p>Over the next year and a half, I continued my work with the Center. My understanding of the nuance and challenges that face systems change in education grew and I cultivated my professional identity as I worked at this nonprofit as my first real job. I witnessed firsthand what it takes to juggle multiple projects, upskill while maintaining ongoing processes, and navigate the interpersonal dynamics of a team spread across three timezones. These experiences opened unexpected doors like getting to co-facilitate a breakout session at the Systems Awareness Lab Conference at MIT in January of 2025 or joining a growing network of compassionate systems practitioners in Japan.</p>
        <p>This framework has taught me more about myself than anything else. I'm forever indebted to the wonderful people who have guided me along the way and now I'm ready to give back—to bring these tools, practices, and spirit to the communities that need them most.</p>

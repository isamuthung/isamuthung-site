        <p class="opening-paragraph">I first arrived in Hakuba, Japan in the summer of 2024 after being invited by Tomoko Kusamoto, founder of Hakuba International School (HIS), to intern at the third session of its week-long summer program. Despite having lived in Japan for five years with my family earlier, we had rarely traveled outside Yokohama City, so experiencing a rural village nestled between snow-capped mountains that shimmer in July felt magical. I had met Tomoko-san through my mom, who had done a translation gig for her a while back. What was most fortuitous was discovering that she had gone through the same Compassionate Systems Master Practitioner program I was completing at the time—and her project was to build the very school where I would be interning.</p>

        <p>Even though we'd just met, we quickly realized we shared a vision for education—one that integrated sustainable living, systems thinking, and a strong sense of community. The team included Tomoko-san, Akiko Horii, a few college students, another high schooler from One Stone (an innovative school in Boise, Idaho), a handful of HIS middle school interns, and myself. Together, we were responsible for about a dozen students for a week of outdoor adventures and learning what it means to live harmoniously with each other and the planet. Our main project was meant to be the World Peace Game—a complex simulation played on a life-sized plexiglass structure with figurines, toy battleships, and paper cutouts, designed to teach the realities of solving global crises through diplomacy. But the day before we were set to begin, Akiko-san, the game's certified facilitator, fell ill. That left us scrambling past midnight to figure out what to do instead.</p>
        <p>"Duck syndrome" describes the phenomenon of appearing calm on the surface while paddling furiously beneath the water. That's exactly what those first days felt like. In place of the World Peace Game, we pivoted to a Model UN, with each group researching an assigned country and collaborating on a global climate change solution. Thanks to the relentless effort and sleepless nights of the team, we managed to stay afloat and move forward as planned. And with the reshuffled schedule, a new opportunity emerged: I volunteered to teach custom lessons on topics I was passionate about.</p>
        <p>Given my goal of becoming a teacher, it felt like a miracle to be able to teach freely, without the limitations of a traditional classroom. Aligning with the program's themes, I ran a workshop on ecosystems, guiding students to model the dynamics between plant and animal species. Continuing with the idea of interconnectedness, I taught them how the internet works—from miles of underwater cables to the access point and router that might be located right in that building. We explored websites tracking planes across the globe and satellites orbiting the Earth, appreciating the complex systems humanity has built to keep society running. I also guided them to explore their own "human system," showing how prioritizing personal well-being is what enables us to contribute meaningfully to others. Looking back, that week must have been exhausting for everyone, but I don't remember the stress or frantic paddling—I remember it as one of the best weeks of my summer.</p>
              <p>A year later, I was invited back, but this time I wasn't just a helpful intern—I co-designed the entire program, now with double the participants for double the time. The original plan was for a U.S.-based professional camp counselor to fly to Japan and run the program, but weeks before it began, a medical emergency prevented him from coming. That left me and Issac Bryan, another pre-college student familiar with the work, to organize the two-week experience. We spent weeks building the schedule, planning outdoor activities, and designing the main project. Our collaborators included Tomoko-san, Chris Paxton (a teacher at HIS), two adults highly experienced in outdoor leadership who became essential for camp logistics, and five exceptional HIS interns just entering high school but already far beyond their years.</p>

        <p>With 24 students to oversee around the clock, we had no time for breaks. Running a summer program with two dozen middle schoolers proved far more complex than we'd imagined. We quickly memorized names and personalities to create advisory and project groups that balanced friendships with productive pairings. We stuck to the plan—visiting Matsumoto Castle, hiking up Iwatake Mountain and Happo Pond, and camping overnight on the bank of Aoki Lake, where paddleboarding and swimming became the trip's highlight. Drawing from their outdoor experiences, we led a research project on local sustainability initiatives, culminating in a pitch competition to real community leaders.</p>
      <p>The work was as fulfilling and fun as it was exhausting. When things went smoothly, it was easy—but mediating conflicts, setting boundaries, and ensuring every student felt seen and safe required real dedication and heart. The most enduring lesson was this: to truly care for others, you must first care for yourself. As tensions rose over the weeks, mistakes surfaced and decision fatigue set in. But with guidance from the adults in the space—and the refreshing reset of our swim in Aoki Lake—we pushed through, doing our best each day to create a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the students.</p>
              <p>Those two weeks were a masterclass in trusting my team, engaging in productive dialogue, and rising to the occasion whenever possible. Although there are far more memories from those weeks, the greatest gift was the clarity it gave me that purposeful education is built on trust, adaptability, and empathy—and that if my future holds more summers like Hakuba, I am exactly where I'm meant to be.</p>

        <p class="opening-paragraph">By the time I entered High Tech High Mesa (HTHM), I had already attended eight schools. After years of experiencing traditional teaching, I had concluded that school simply wasn't for me. That belief would be quickly overturned at HTHM, but in the years leading up to it, I was on the verge of quitting school altogether to carve out a different path. Things hadn't always been that way. In fact, I loved school while attending public elementary school in Japan. There, even 1st-graders walked to school on their own, and I was young enough not to analyze education as a system—I simply experienced each day as a new adventure with something to strive for. My peers took their studies seriously, and the teachers balanced playfulness with a clear sense of purpose. I didn't appreciate that balance until much later in life. Those early years shaped my childhood—joining the school band as a percussionist, eating delicious school lunches, rehearsing for the music festival. After moving back, it would be a while before I felt that happy again in school.</p>

        <p>Middle school in the U.S. began at a small charter school with only 50 kids in my grade. The pace lagged far behind what I was used to, and many classmates seemed disengaged, treating school as a place to socialize rather than learn. That was fall 2019—soon after, COVID hit and everything went online, dampening my frustrations but replacing them with isolation. Around the same time, our house flooded, forcing my family into nine months of hotels and Airbnbs while repairs were made. Navigating adolescence in quarantine—waking up only to sit in front of a laptop listening to teachers lecture a grid of black screens—left me feeling disillusioned and numb.</p>

        <p>A turning point came a few months into this monotony when I discovered two podcasts—Unlocking Us and Dare to Lead—hosted by researcher and author Brené Brown. I was fascinated by her ability to give language to what I thought were amorphous emotions through grounded-theory research. These conversations with scholars, authors, and thought leaders became my gateway to a broader intellectual world—one that traditional academics had never revealed to me. With my curiosity reignited, I felt like there was now a new challenge on the horizon. School remained dull, but now I had a parallel education: reading her books, exploring new disciplines, and seeing how they eloquently parsed complex ideas to get to the crux of an argument. It felt like I had glimpsed a portal to the real world—and it was calling me to jump through.</p>
        <p>By the end of eighth grade, I had given up on school, so when faced with the choice of staying at my performing arts school or transferring to HTHM, I chose the latter mainly because the commute would be easier for my parents. I assumed academics would be no better than my previous schools. What I underestimated was how a project-based learning environment—and the educators it attracted—could completely transform my sense of possibility.</p>

        <p>With everyone still masked up and social-distancing, I entered my 9th-grade fine arts class not expecting much, but in that first encounter with D. Smith, I became enamored by the prospect that this was no ordinary class. We dived straight into a lesson on color theory, yet blended with his unmatched charisma, witty humor, and jaw-dropping anecdotes from a decade of teaching, it felt like stepping into a Picasso painting—unsetting at first, but once you step back and saw the idiosyncrasy as a whole, it was plain captivating. Then, just as I thought I'd met the best teacher I'd ever have, I walked next door and was greeted by my Humanities teacher, Matt Darling. In that first week we talked about unceded territory, community values, and glimpsed what our first project would be. Matt's story coming back into teaching is a gut-wrenching one that's intertwined with his personal life, but that irrevocable history is what breathed life into his teaching and the dedication he had towards his students was infectious.</p>

        <p>Independently, D.'s and Matt's class were distinct and brilliant in their own ways. But when the walls separating their rooms were folded away and all 60 students had their eyes on them both, an unparalleled chemistry was born as they bounced ideas off each other, changed plans in a heartbeat when something made more sense, or magically turned chaos into collaboration as we worked on our project.</p>
        <p>What was apparent through their actions was that they genuinely cared for each and every one of us and wanted to see us succeed. Every decision they made in those classrooms was in service of that greater goal. Not only did they love their work, they honed their craft akin to how a swordsman might sharpen their blade---with integrity, honor, and passion. It seemed they were born to teach, and for us students, seeing them take their work seriously motivated us to reciprocate the effort and do the same.</p>

        <p>Our project, Uncommon Message, centered around uplifting the stories of marginalized heroes throughout history. By blending principles of art and design with our analysis of redlining maps, the close-reading of obituaries, and iterative writing cycles, each group created original designs that told the story of these heroes and we organized a pop-up market on a public street to sell screenprinted T-shirts and totebags, and to display our sculptures and writing pieces.</p>
        <p>Our collective efforts culminated in a singular exhibition that Matt and D. masterfully facilitated at first but we carried it across the finish line. But the greatest change happened in me when I finally believed again that school could be something greater than what I experienced before and that first semester would be what catalyzed the rest of my high school journey.</p>

        <p>From then on I became obsessed with one question: what would it take to bring the magic that I experienced there into every classroom? Even in the second semester of 9th-grade where our classes changed, I was disappointed to find that not every project was automatically golden. It took time for me to reset my expectations and to reframe my frustration as an opportunity to revisit my assumptions. I realized that simply operating in a project-based learning school didn't guarantee a rockstar project and I hypothesized there were underlying conditions, often intangible qualities, that impact the student experience.</p>
        <p>I sought to understand it better and I became inquisitive and at times rebellious. I'd disrupt practices that felt stagnant and wasn't afraid to vocalize my opinions. At times, my sentiment came off as brash and might've rubbed people the wrong way, but I had to learn how to strike a healthy balance between advocating for what could be and acknowledging what's there. I had to stop blaming people for all their actions and recognize that decisions that feel personal were often guided by an invisible hand dictated by the larger system.</p>

        <p>With each new project and each new teacher, it expanded the range of information I pulled from to inform my vision on what a classroom should look like. In 10th-grade math we designed and launched rockets and built a bamboo fort from scratch. I directed a modified version of The Crucible, a play about the Salem witch trials as we drew parallels to McCarthyism, political propaganda, and modern media.</p>
        <p>In a project that combined science and humanities, every student wrote a research paper on one environmental topic---I chose sustainable architecture---and we published an anthology of all our pieces purchasable on Amazon. Then in junior year we organized a runway show with the entire school as our audience as we examined 100 years of American history through the lens of fashion.</p>

        <p>We partnered with Illumina, the biotech company, to run DNA extraction experiments, tour their campus, and have a mini-documentary filmed about our class. Over the course of four years I went on countless field trips and collaborated with dozens of community partners. Notably, we went to the Zoo and Safari park multiple times to learn about conservation efforts with White Rhinos or endangered frog species.</p>
        <p>And we had a project where we organized a fundraiser for the oncology department at our local children's hospital as we learned about the science and politics surrounding cancer by hearing first-hand stories of a survivor, a bone marrow donor, and from associations like the DMV organ donor program or the Gift of Life bone marrow registry.</p>

        <p>In a project called Lithium Valley, we learned about the degrading environmental conditions at the Salton Sea and the lithium deposits in the region and we considered the stakeholder perspective from all sides---from the lithium extraction companies, local citizens, politicians, environmental advocates, and native tribes---to make informed decision on what policy is best for everyone.</p>
        <p>Then during the last month of 11th-grade, we had our month-long internship program where Matt Darling, who by then moved to the Bay Area to become a high school administrator at Summit Prep, became my mentor. I worked alongside him to understand his role in operating a school, and I facilitated an end-of-year professional development for their faculty and I learned about the power of coding, spreadsheets, and automation to develop a script that generated their graduation ceremony slideshow along with other administrative tools.</p>

        <p>When senior year rolled around, everyone's focus was on college applications, and with the guidance of our exceptional college counselor Chirs White, I wrote personal essays about my experiences at HTHM and the educational fields, and after getting accepted into Stanford University, I've decided to commit to there knowing that the peers and faculty I meet there me will challenge me in ways I've yet to anticipate and where I'll enter the next chapter of my life.</p>
        <p>It's ironic that as someone who vocalized not wanting to go to college in defiance of its rigid structures and predetermined curricula that I ended up at arguably the most prestigious institution on the West Coast. In some ways, it's a relief that my relentless obsession with understanding the ins and outs of educational systems was recognized by a valued entity and it's as if getting into Stanford justifies the crazy ambitions that I've had before it.</p>

        <p>But in other ways, I'm wary of the trap that I could easily fall into. Assuming I graduate from Stanford, it provides a safety net that even if things go awry, I'm guaranteed a relatively stable life even if I put minimal effort in now. But this is no time to let my guard down. In fact, I view it as quite the opposite. Given the privileges and unfair advantages I had access to that have led me to this position, I owe it to the people that got me here to work even harder to leap at the opportunities afforded to me and create something that'll impact more than just me.</p>
        <p>My aspirations for educational change are sky high, and my ambitions for my own life are high as well. In the final years of high school, right after dabbling with software during my junior internship, I began to explore what an entrepreneurial path might look like and what the payoff could be. It's always been my dream to be a classroom teacher at some point, perhaps at HTHM, but before I settle into that role, I want to take a shot at surpassing the limits of what I'm capable of.</p>
        <p>A trend throughout my life is that I've always swam out to just past the frontier of what I can do. As a student, after I aced the academic game, I then began seeing what it takes to be the teacher, then jumped at the chance to understand how to orchestrate the whole school system, and so on. It seems like as soon as I feel comfortable in one pond, I have to dive into the bigger one next to it. Similarly in life post-college, the first step is doing well at your own work, then to manage a team of people, and then to orchestrate a whole organization in service of a greater mission.</p>

        <p>If I were to choose the most challenging frontier that I could aim for, then starting a nonprofit or a company seems like the level I will eventually compete at. What's fascinating about education and entrepreneurship is that they're both just frameworks without inherent substance. While each are considered standalone industries, they don't elucidate on the content itself.</p>
        <p>Education is designed so that anything could be taught within that system. Entrepreneurship doesn't dictate the kind of business an entrepreneur will create, it's just a set of generalized ideas that apply to starting any business. In both cases, the specifics of what's actually happening is up to people that are doing the actual work. All throughout high school, I've thought about the best frameworks for learning and the conditions needed to nurture curiosity, but in service of what? What's the end goal of all of it? To learn endlessly without purpose? I don't agree.</p>

        <p>I'll end with this. I've stated my vision is to live in a world where the systems around us help people lead fulfilling and successful lives in the ways each of us define them. And that final part is the most essential. In the ways each of us define them. Figuring out what matters to us in life and reverse engineering the path to getting there is a burden placed upon all our shoulders. Most people are conditioned to learn and work in the promise that a better life is ahead of them. But by the time people retire, it's too late. Life has passed you by and the question might haunt us: did we live the lives we wanted to?</p>
        <p>But I want to flip that script. Right now there are thousands of people living the lifestyle I want and for someone else, there are probably thousands living the life that they want and it's okay that they're different. I believe that everybody has their own version of the life they want to lead, and it's up to us to keep an eye out for it, put ourselves out into the world, revise our vision, and continue moving forward. Because if we repeat this cycle enough, we're bound to get there.</p>

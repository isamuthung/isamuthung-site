        <p class="opening-paragraph">At High Tech High, the junior-year internship—a graduation requirement—is taken seriously, with preparations beginning in late fall for the month-long program held during the final four weeks of school. We learn how to craft professional emails, refine our résumés, and excel in job interviews. While the school provides strong scaffolding, each student is ultimately responsible for finding and securing a mentor at an internship site that resonates with their interests and offers the rigor to make the experience truly worthwhile. When it came time for me to choose my mentor, I didn't start with the type of work I wanted to do—I started with the kind of person I wanted to learn from. One name stood out immediately: Matt Darling.</p>
        
        <p>As my ninth-grade Humanities teacher, Matt reignited my spark for learning at a time when I was deeply disillusioned with school. He showed me that, with the right approach and the right people, authentic learning can flourish. By my junior year, he had been at Summit Prep High School for nearly two years, leading its Expeditions program—a model where six weeks of traditional instruction are followed by two weeks of off-campus internships or immersive workshops in fields like barbering, cooking, or programming. His responsibilities there were broad and varied, but my decision to work with him had little to do with his official role. I chose him because of the way he had shaped me when he was my teacher—and because the lessons he left me with were ones I wanted to carry forward.</p>

        <p>When he was my teacher, it was clear he loved his craft and fiercely advocated for every student's success. Together with his teaching partner, D. Smith, he transcended the traditional definition of a teacher. They saw their work not as handing out assignments, but as answering a daily question: What can we do to help these students become better versions of themselves? They weren't afraid to throw out the plan, pivot on the spot, or experiment with something completely new if it meant students were growing. That relentless willingness to try, adjust, and try again reflected a deeper truth: students change, society changes, and if education doesn't evolve alongside them, it falls behind. To teach well is to experiment often.</p>

        <p>I was the only student interning outside of San Diego, and I stayed with a family friend while fundraising to cover a month of living expenses. It worked out that Matt could pick me up on his commute to Summit Prep, and one of the unexpected highlights of the internship became our forty-minute drives each way—the conversations we had in that car were as valuable as anything I learned on campus.</p>
        
        <p>During my first week, I shadowed him, seeing the school through an administrator's lens for the first time. I sat in on partnership negotiations and closed-door meetings, met the other administrators, and got to know the faculty. I noticed both the parallels to my own school—the open-concept spaces, the innovative programming—and the differences, such as a stronger emphasis on college resources and distinct community norms. Unsurprisingly, Matt had deep rapport with students, especially those lingering in hallways or drifting between classes. He understood that their stories mattered more than the numbers on their transcripts, and that's why they respected him. I realized that the true gift of educators lies in the heart they bring to their work, underscoring a truth that pierced me deeply: education is rooted in human connection, and it is the collective growth of people that makes a school more than just a building.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <p>In those first few weeks I focused on surveying students and interviewing teachers about the realities they faced each day. I tried understanding how to better use Mentor Time, a first-period block where in theory teachers can support students individually, but often ends up being a hollow experience with students glued to their phones, teachers typing on their laptops, or some who didn't show up at all. The pressure to dial in academic instruction elbowed out the need to prioritize connection, yet I knew investing in a culture of trust and engagement would better serve students in the long run.</p>

      <section class="content-section">

              <p>I recognized that the impact of what I could do in the final four weeks of school was limited, but I focused my efforts on building assets that could outlast me, and inspire teachers to revisit their own practices and reflect on the kind of person they want to show up as. This culminated in an end-of-year professional development workshop that I facilitated which got teachers talking about the entry points for connecting with students and modeling a student-led conference to underscore the aspirational goal of having students reflect on their own experiences and learning.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <p>The second avenue I explored during my internship was the role of software and data systems in shaping a school's operations. Even when Matt was a classroom teacher, he experimented with ways to aggregate student feedback and uncover insights to inform his practice. As an administrator, those digital skills became indispensable as he worked with the countless databases and documents his role required. For me, this was a first foray into software. I began with simple spreadsheet formulas—referencing data across columns, matching names with IDs, writing if/else statements, filtering queries. As tasks grew more complex and impactful, I saw how mastering digital systems could do more than automate routine work—it could unlock the potential of data in ways that opened new possibilities for student learning.</p>
        
        <p>One project that truly tested me was automating the slideshow for the school's graduation ceremony. In a spreadsheet, we gathered student names, senior and baby photos, graduating quotes, and links to their chosen background music. With no prior experience in coding or software, I turned to ChatGPT and learned to use Google Apps Script to bring the project to life. Along the way, I picked up the basics of APIs and JavaScript, breaking down big goals into small, logical steps I could hand off to the computer. It took dozens of trials and errors—spotting what went wrong, diagnosing the issue, fixing it, and trying again. Progress came slowly: first I managed to load the elements into the template slide, then I fine-tuned the margins, ensured the aspect ratios stayed intact, and gradually pieced together a system that worked. The breakthrough moment came when I clicked a button and watched the script automatically generate the complete slideshow. The best part wasn't just that it worked—it was that I had created an asset that Matt and future administrators could reuse for years to come. That's when I realized the power of building systems: they don't just solve problems once, they create lasting structures that make future work easier, more efficient, and more impactful.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <p>I went on to write a few more scripts, including one that automated personalized emails for collecting late AP exam payments. Each project pushed me further into coding, until I found myself exploring IT, software architecture, and even the foundations of how the internet works. Once I had my foot in the door, curiosity took over. I began to see problems through the lens of digital systems and recognized that much of modern work—and life itself—rests on this hidden infrastructure. After my internship with Matt ended, I jumped at the chance to volunteer with the IT Director, Tommy at my high school. Over three weeks, I logged nearly 100 hours and engaged with every aspect of his job: maintaining hundreds of student Chromebooks, cleaning projector filters, even building an online ticketing system for facilities requests. The experience gave me a new appreciation for the often invisible, thankless work that makes a school function seamlessly each day. In return for my labor, I gained mentorship from an industry expert and guidance on the skills and concepts I could pursue to build the kind of digital systems capable of driving lasting educational change.</p>
        
        <p>Both my internship in the Bay Area and my work at my own high school shaped what I want to do in life by demonstrating the power of strong mentorships and the subtle importance of systems. Matt reminded me that education is about people—the connections and stories that make us human—while Tommy helped me see the invisible infrastructure that I took for granted for three years. I recognize lasting change happens at the intersection of human connection and digital architecture and everywhere I go, I now ask what system could make this better? These experiences shaped my ambitions to build a future that lies at the intersection of people and systems where I can keep experimenting, learning, and creating value that will help others thrive long after I've stepped away.</p>

            <p>For those who have recognized that schools need rethinking and are inspired to change the existing system or create a new one, a common challenge persists: in every innovative model, there are always students who merely coexist within the system but don't fully engage with it. The truth is, getting every student to feel like they're learning something meaningful at all times is a nearly insurmountable task—and it might not even be the right one.</p>
            
            <p>But this doesn't mean continuous learning or intrinsic engagement is impossible; on the contrary, it happens often—just not in the settings we're used to. When we're immersed in a meaningful conversation with people we care about, when we're invested in the exchange, that's what intrinsic learning looks like. It doesn't feel like "learning" in the traditional sense, and the topic may not be academic, but the desire to participate in that conversation is the essence of intrinsic engagement.</p>
            
            <p>Some might argue that while an engaging conversation is fine over dinner, it's not what school should be like. Others believe learning isn't meant to be intrinsic at all, but rather difficult and imposed on students. After all, students don't know what they don't know, so the only way to get them to learn something new is to attach negative consequences to failure. But this is not only a crude description of the current school model—it's also a narrow view of what learning is and could be.</p>
            
            <p>We are born curious. Curiosity is a survival trait and an evolutionary advantage. Successful learning is continuous and effortless until institutions begin to suppress this innate drive. When people talk about innovating education, it's usually with the belief that what's best for young people isn't just the ability to score well on tests or memorize information, but something deeper.</p>
            
            <p>From what I've observed, most new styles of schooling fall into one or more of these categories:</p>
            
            <p>Cultivating different skills and competencies.</p>
            
            <p>Offering personalized learning to students.</p>
            
            <p>Exposing students to real-world experiences.</p>
            
            <p>Most new school systems blend these categories, often through a differentiated curriculum, non-academic programs, or holistic assessment models. While these are great ideas, they often stop short of the most important question: What are these changes in service of? Many innovative schools are clear on what they want to do, but less clear on why—and being different from the status quo is only the first step toward truly reimagining education.</p>
            
            <p>Schools founded by well-intentioned pioneers often end up in a state of dissonance between what the institution was supposed to look and feel like versus the reality students experience. Trailblazers of "new" education frequently fall into the same trap: based on their success in motivating a handful of students to learn in a new way, they believe they can engineer a system that scales and works the same across hundreds.</p>
            
            <p>Many visions for schools are implemented without being validated with the audience they aim to serve—students. "Without" isn't quite accurate; it's more that they can't validate their ideas beforehand. The crux of education's struggle to change is that you can't truly test the concept for a school without actually creating that school.</p>
            
            <p>Trying a model with a small group of students is very different from building a structure that consistently works for hundreds. That difference can make or break a school's success. Research can offer valuable insights, but it's no substitute for what students will actually experience day-to-day. This means every school is, by nature, an experiment—one that must keep running once it starts.</p>
            
            <p>Once a school is in motion, it can't simply pause for a full redesign. It runs until it either evolves within its constraints or shuts down entirely. And when a school closes, assessing how enjoyable it was is rarely the priority. Launching a new model of education is an instant sunk-cost scenario; from the moment the doors open, there's an unspoken commitment to keep it going for years. This is why founders spend so much time trying to "perfect" their model in advance—yet the truth is, no one knows what's best for students until they've tried it in practice.</p>
            
            <p>Education operates on a timeline unlike any other industry. If you sell peanut butter, you can launch a new product in months and discontinue it if it fails. In education, founding a school means building an entire organization from the ground up, and if it's less than ideal, you can't simply pull it off the shelves.</p>
            
            <p>If there's a silver lining, it's that the slow, stubborn nature of education change also means that every bold experiment—no matter how imperfect—becomes part of a long, collective apprenticeship in reimagining what school can be. Every attempt, whether it thrives or fails, leaves behind a trail of insights for the next set of dreamers to pick up and refine. The truth is, there will never be a single, flawless model that works for every student in every context—and maybe that's the point. Education, at its best, is alive: it evolves through conversation, adapts to the needs of the moment, and grows richer the more voices are welcomed into shaping it. If we can keep our curiosity intact, keep listening to the students we serve, and accept that progress comes not in perfect leaps but in persistent steps, then each generation of schools will be better equipped to nurture the innate hunger for learning that we all start life with. The work is slow, but the possibility is vast.</p>
